# ü§ñ (KMTS) Kikipatsu, Maki, Tori and Stronger AI ‚Äì Multi-Agent System (LangChain + OpenAI + Together AI)

This project demonstrates a modular **multi-agent AI system** built using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), OpenAI's GPT models, and Together AI. It showcases how agents can collaborate toward a shared goal by simulating the behavior of a Planner, a Coder, and a Critic ‚Äî just like a real-world development team.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Python 3.9+
- [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com)
- [OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com)
- [Together AI](https://together.ai) for image and audio generation
- Callback tracking via `get_openai_callback`

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install langchain langchain_openai langchain_together requests tabulate
```

### 2. Set Your API Keys

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key-here"
export TOGETHER_API_KEY="your-together-key-here"
```

### 3. Run the Program

```bash
python main.py
```

## üìù Documentation

The system supports three main modes:
1. **General Chat/Instructions**: Interact with AI models for text generation
2. **Audio Generation**: Create audio files from text input with voice selection
3. **Image Generation**: Generate images from text prompts with model and parameter selection

### Image Generation Models
- FLUX.1.1 Pro - High quality image generation
- FLUX.1 Schnell - Fast image generation model
- FLUX.1 Depth - Image generation with depth perception (requires reference image)

### Audio Generation Models
- Sonic - High-quality text-to-speech model
- Sonic 2 - Improved text-to-speech with enhanced naturalness
